    <h1>About Anankaion</h1>

    <h2>The Name</h2>

    <p>
        Anankaion is greek for "necessary". The term goes back to ancient greek philosopher Aristotle.
        It is used in his famous Metaphysics and counts as one of the first pillars of the theory of modality.
        I used this name since I love Aristotle, scholasticism and modal theory.
    </p>

    <h2>The Idea</h2>
    <p>
        This website (and my whole life) is built upon the idea that ideas matter. I also think that ideas in general
        matter, and not just ideas in academic form (altough I really love those too.)
        I blieve that all forms of human knowledge are interconnected and that, by traversing various nodes, we can
        arrive <em>at</em> any node <em>from</em> any node. Therefore all knowledge is important.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, in times as these, the amount of knowledge that humankind has surmounted surpasses the capabilities of one
        single individual. That's why it is important to take a step back and not just produce more knowledge, but connect the
        various dots. That is usually the task of philosophy. In that sense this is a philosophical website.
